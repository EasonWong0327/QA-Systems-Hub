## 🤖 **Agent-based QA System Architecture**

> **Autonomous question-answering systems based on intelligent agents, supporting tool calling, long-chain reasoning, task decomposition, and other complex capabilities**

###  **Why Separate Agent-based QA?**

####  **Technical Architecture Differences**
- **Traditional QA Systems**: Primarily based on retrieval, matching, and generation with **single-interaction modes**
- **Agent-based QA**: Possesses **autonomous decision-making capabilities**, supporting multi-turn interactions, tool calling, task decomposition, and other **complex behavior chains**

####  **Essential Differences in Interaction Modes** 
- **Core QA**: Question → Answer (relatively static mapping relationship)
- **Agent QA**: Question → Planning → Execution → Reflection → Answer (dynamic reasoning process)

| **Agent Type**         | **Core Capabilities**                                                                                 | **Technical Features**                                                   | **Project Link**                                                            | **Status** | **Use Cases**          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **🎯 Planner-Executor** | **Task Planning & Execution**: Automatically decompose complex tasks and coordinate execution, supporting workflow management                 | Task decomposition, execution coordination, workflow orchestration                 | [🚧 Planner-Executor-QA]()                                     | ⏳ **In Development**   | Complex business process automation           |
| **🔧 Tool-Using**      | **Tool-Calling Agent**: Dynamically calls external tools and APIs, expanding Q&A capability boundaries                                      | API integration, tool selection, dynamic calling     | [🚧 Tool-Using-QA]()                                           | ⏳ **In Development**   | Data querying, service integration         |
| **🔄 ReAct**           | **Reasoning-Action Loop**: Observe-Think-Act循环模式, supporting complex reasoning chains                                         | Reflection mechanisms, reasoning chains, self-correction            | [🚧 ReAct-QA]()                                                | ⏳ **In Development**   | Complex reasoning, problem diagnosis             |

## 🧠 Enterprise-level Hybrid QA Strategy

In actual business scenarios, a single QA system cannot meet all needs. Enterprises often adopt **Hybrid QA** strategies:

### 🔀 **Routing Strategy Design**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Question] --> B[Intent Recognition]
    B --> C{Question Type}
    C -->|Common Questions| D[FQA System]
    C -->|Knowledge Queries| E[KBQA System]  
    C -->|Document Q&A| F[RAG System]
    C -->|Data Queries| G[Text2SQL System]
    C -->|Complex Tasks| H[Agent System]
    
    D --> I[Answer Fusion]
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J[Final Answer]
```

### 🎯 **Typical Combination Patterns**
- **🏢 Enterprise Knowledge Assistant**: FQA + KBQA + LLM-based QA
- **📊 Business Analysis Platform**: Text-to-SQL + LLM-based QA + Agent
- **🎨 Creative Design Tools**: Multimodal QA + Agent-based QA
- **🔬 Research Support System**: KBQA + Long-Chain Agent + Tool-Using Agent

> 📌 **Repository Strategy**: Rather than directly implementing Hybrid QA, we provide a collection of "capability components" needed for construction.
> 👉 We recommend selecting appropriate components for combination based on specific business scenarios.
